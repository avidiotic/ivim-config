## iVim Config

This repo contains the configuration that I use on [iVim](https://github.com/terrychou/iVim) running on my iPad. Due to the nature of iVim, the configuration might not work similarly on other versions of Vim.

### Contents

* `.vimrc` file
* `material-hybrid` colorscheme file from [`vim-material-hybrid`](https://github.com/kristijanhusak/vim-hybrid-material)
* Patched Nerd Font compatible font for JetBrains Mono from [`nerd-fonts`](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts)
